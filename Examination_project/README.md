What I have done
I have done part A B
Part A was to implement the bi linear interpolation.
Part B was to implemnent the double integral analytically, because it has to be analytic I assumed that the area is a square like we assumed in the our interpolation HW.

If you want to change anything those are the calling funcs
-startx: ..
-starty: ..
-endx: ..
-endy: ..
-splinepoints: ..
