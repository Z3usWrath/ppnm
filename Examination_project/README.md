What I have done
I have done part A B
Part A was to implement the bi linear interpolation. at the end of part A I plot a graph to show that the algorithm and the tabulated points agree.
Part B was to implemnent the double integral analytically, because it has to be analytic I assumed that the area is a square like we assumed in the our interpolation HW.

If you want to change anything those are the calling funcs
